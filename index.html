      Welcome to Acyclic! I'm a sophomore at Georgia Tech experimenting
      with using mathematics and algorithms to translate languages. Right now
      only basic one word translations are availible, but I'm working on
      improving the algorithms, language options, and datasets.

    <h3>Why am I getting an incorrect translation?</h3>
    <p>
      Programming a translator comes with the inherent challenge of assigning
      logical meaning to words, phrases, and other parts of a language.
      Languages, however, are a human construct. They are often gramatically and
      syntactically inconsistent and rely heavily on context clues to have
      meaning. Ever since you were born, you've built an intuition for
      understanding these clues - whether that be through recognizing the
      context of a situation, connotations of words, irony, etc. In order to
      distinguish between the various meanings of a word or phrase, a translator
      must seek to emulate this intuition. Natural language processing, the
      field of linguistics and computer science that deals with this challenge,
      is among the most complex and researched areas of study today.

    <h3>How does this work?</h3>
    <p>
      Acyclic uses a reinforcement learning approach to identify words. It
      creates a bipartite graph where one side has words in English and the
      other has words in the input language (suppose for the sake of this
      example that this is Sindarin). Initially the probability a Sindarin
      word is translated as any speicific English word is equal for all English
      words. Now suppose there is a pair of sentences in the training set where
      the word <i>hello</i> appears in the first sentence and <i>suilad</i>
      appears in the second. Then the weight of the edge between these two words
      would increase. This, in turn, would increase the chance the words are
      translated as each other since the probability <i>hello</i> is translated
      as <i>suilad</i> is the weight of the edge between them divided by the sum
       of the weights of all edges connected to the <i>hello</i> vertex. This is
      a general overview of the method I've used, but there are also various
      optimizations (e.g. edge weights increase more if sentences are
      shorter, capitalized words aren't changed, etc.).
    </p>

    <p>
      As of now, the only training set used is the 1000 parallel sentences data
       set on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/parallelsents). This is a
      far smaller corpus than what I'd need to make an accurate translator,
      which explains why Acyclic currently makes mistakes for all but simple
      sentences. The small size of the data set, however, lets me better
      understand the errors and how to improve the program.
